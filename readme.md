# Reverse Snake
In this project, I wanted to put a twist on the classic snake game:
Instead of moving forwards, the snake moves backwards. To accommodate for this change, the snake now eats with its tail. This possibly has great consequences for existing play styles for "regular" snake, as everything will now be reversed.
